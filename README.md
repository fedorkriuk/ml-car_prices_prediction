# Machine Learning | Car Prices Prediction
 - Performed interactive data visualization using Seaborn and Plotly
 - Ploted WordCloud
 - Prepared the data to increase the predictive power of Machine Learning (ML) models by One-Hot Encoding, Feature dropping, and Train/Test Split
 - Built and trained Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost models to predict the price of the used cars
 - Calculated Regression Metrics from the trained models and compare the accuracy score
